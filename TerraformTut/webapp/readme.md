1. ### terraform block: ###
    This sets up the backend for storing Terraform state files 

2. ### provider aws: ### 
   This sets the AWS region for the resources.

3. ### EC2 instances
   `resource "aws_instance" "instance_1"` and `resource "aws_instance" "instance_2"`: These blocks create two AWS EC2 instances with a user data script that starts a simple HTTP server.

4. ### S3 bucket
   `resource "aws_s3_bucket"`: This creates an S3 bucket with a specific prefix and enables force destroy to allow the bucket to be destroyed even if it contains objects.

5. `resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning"`: This enables versioning for the S3 bucket.

6. `resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration"`: This enables server-side encryption for the S3 bucket.

7. ### VPC
   `data "aws_vpc" "default_vpc"` and `data "aws_subnet_ids" "default_subnet"`: These data blocks fetch the default VPC and its subnets.

8. ### Security groups
   `resource "aws_security_group"` and `resource "aws_security_group_rule"`: These create security groups and rules for the instances and the load balancer.

9.  ### Load balancer
    `resource "aws_lb_listener"`, `resource "aws_lb_target_group"`, `resource "aws_lb_target_group_attachment"`, `resource "aws_lb_listener_rule"`: These create a load balancer, target groups, and listener rules to distribute incoming HTTP traffic across the two instances.

    `resource "aws_lb"`: This creates an application load balancer.

10. ### Route 53
    `resource "aws_route53_zone"` and `resource "aws_route53_record"`: These create a Route53 hosted zone and a DNS record that points to the load balancer.



The script assumes that the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for storing the Terraform state file are already set up. It also assumes that the security groups specified in the EC2 instance creation are already created.
